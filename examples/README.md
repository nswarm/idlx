# protox Examples

Inputs for all examples live in `input` except for any that use built-ins such as `flatbuffers`, which is under `builtin` at the top of the repo.

## CLI Examples

The script `run-examples.sh` shows examples of running protox as a command line utility.

Outputs are generated in the folder `output`.

## Build Script Examples

The cargo build script `build.rs` shows an example of using protox as a build script.

Outputs are generated in the top-level `target` directory.
